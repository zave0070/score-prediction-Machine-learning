Score Prediction using Machine Learning & NLP

This project applies machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to predict scores based on textual and numerical data. The aim is to explore how language patterns and statistical features can improve prediction accuracy.

Project Overview

The project demonstrates the full pipeline of a predictive modeling workflow:

Data preprocessing (cleaning and transformation)

Feature extraction from text (TF-IDF, embeddings)

Model building using machine learning algorithms

Evaluation with accuracy and error metrics

Insights and interpretation of results

Technologies Used

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)

NLP Libraries (NLTK / spaCy for preprocessing, Scikit-learn vectorizers)

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

Features
