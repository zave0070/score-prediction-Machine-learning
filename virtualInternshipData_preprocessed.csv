2c,Introduction and Workflow Tutorial with Entrance Interview,Player,69,"1.As soon as you submit a notebook to Alex he will review it and then send feedback as soon as he can. While you are waiting, you should assist any of your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable. Your team will not be able to move on to the next task until each of your team members' notebooks have been witnessed.



2.Once Alex receives your notebook you should receive an email with feedback shortly thereafter. I recommend completing any notebook revisions or helping your teammates finish their deliverables while you wait for his feedback. As soon as all of your team's deliverables have been submitted and witnessed, you can get started on the next task.



3.After you've submitted a notebook and are waiting for feedback from Alex, you should help any of your teammates who haven't submitted their deliverable yet. You could also wrap up notebook revisions you didn't have time to finish earlier. If you still have time before your team meeting, you may want to start working on the final presentation that you will be giving at the end of the internship. You can find an outline of what Alex expects from your presentations in the resource section of Workpro. I recommend that you start working on the background research section of the presentation now.



4.Alex received your notebook and plans on sending some feedback soon. While you wait, revise unfinished notebooks or check to see if your teammates need help completing this deliverable. Once Alex has witnessed the deliverables of everyone on your team, you can all move on to the next task together.



5.Once you've submitted a notebook please assist your teammates who haven't completed the deliverable yet while you wait for the next task. You should also try to complete any outstanding notebooks that still need revisions. Any extra time you have should be spent working on your final presentation. The outline you're expected to follow for your presentations  is located in the resources section of workpro. Now would be a good time to research on the current state of dialysis technology.



6.After you submit a notebook Alex will send you an email with some feedback. While you wait for that email, remember to check and see if your teammates need any assistance. You should also make sure that you've revised incomplete notebooks from previous tasks. Alex won't let your team move forward until he has received a notebook from each of your teammates.



7.Alex wanted me to inform you of a few things you can do after you submit a notebook. You can help your teammates complete their deliverables, revise incomplete notebooks, or work on your presentation. Your presentation should include everything on the presentation outline, which is located in the resources section of Workpro. You may want to consider doing some research on design challenges about developing a dialyzer.



8.Once you've submitted a notebook for the current task, you can expect a response from Alex regarding the quality of your notebook. Until that email arrives, assist your teammates in completing their deliverables or check to make sure you have revised any notebooks Alex has sent back to you. Once everyone on your team has submitted their notebooks, Alex will send you the next task.

9.If you complete your notebook early, there are a few things you should consider doing. You should ask your teammates if they need any help completing their deliverables and complete any of your own notebooks that still need revisions. You should also think about working on your final presentation. In the resources section of Workpro, you can use the presentation outline document to get started on your preparation.



10.If you've completed your notebook and are waiting for the next task you should help your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable yet and work on revising any incomplete notebooks you may have. Also, If you have time before you meet with your new project team, you can work on your final presentation. Use the presentation outline from the resources section of Workpro to guide your preparation.



11.If you've completed your notebook and are waiting for Alex's next task, check to see if your teammates need any help and make sure you're up to date on revisions. Once everyone is finished with this notebook, Alex will send your team its next task



12.Alex stopped by and told me about a few things you can do if you've already submitted a notebook for the current task. You should start by checking to see if your teammates need any help finishing their deliverables or finishing any of your incomplete deliverables. If there's still time before your next meeting, you may want to start working on the references for your final project. It will be useful to reference the presentation outline which can be found in the resources section.



13.After you've submitted a notebook for this deliverable, a feedback email will arrive shortly thereafter. While you wait, ask your teammates if they need any assistance with their deliverables and check to make sure that you are caught up on your deliverable revisions. Alex will only give his next task after everyone has submitted their notebooks.



14.For those of you who are finishing up your notebooks early, Alex gave me a few things you should get started on. While you wait for your next task, you should help your teammates who have not submitted their deliverable yet. Also, make sure that you are up to speed on your own tasks. |4s|If you have time before you meet with your project team, you can also work on your final presentation. I recommend collecting your teams specifications, descriptions, justifications for design choices, and potential limitations for your final prototype. You should also describe which consultants requests your design met and those it did not. |3s|The presentation outline document is a useful tool you can use to see what topics you still need to complete with your teammates before you present.



15.After submitting a notebook, Alex will send you some feedback as quickly as he can. While you wait, it would be great if you could make sure you have revised incomplete notebooks. Once everyone on your team has completed this task, he will send you the final task of your internship.",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1032

3c,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,Player,71,I think steric hindering is a good bet. It's got the second lowest blood cell reactivity and it's about $115 and hour to run above 75% of the original flux,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,30

3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,97,alright,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,so how do we want to go about which 5 we want to submit?,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,14

3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,That would make sense. We all agreed on that surfactant and the data showed 2% and above had the same affect on flux,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,23

3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,i think we should keep nanotubes at 2%,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,8
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,When it is 4% the reliability went up. I think that is worth looking at,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,15
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,96,I agree with Logan,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,4
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,100,My thought was do each process at 2 % then we could try 4 % for a few too,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,19
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,yeah but it depends which attributes we are looking at?,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,10
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,97,yeah me too,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,I think at least one or two should be 4%,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,10
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,Change the process on those maybe,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,6
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,that sounds fine,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,96,That makes sense. Do we want to mess around with the surfactants or just pick one for all the trials?,0,1,1,0,0,0,3,20
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,97,but resources showed the best is 2% right?,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,8
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,100,We could do 2% on each process then 4% on vapor and dry jet because we haven't seen those go together yet at all,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,24
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,depends on what you look at,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,97,Okay.,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,After 2% the flux doesn't go up with the nanotubs,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,10
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,from a reliability stand point it increases but from a cost stand point its not a significant enough change to probably warrant the cost increase,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,25
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,100,4% offered a higher fouling resistance,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,so i guess what we need to decide is what attribute we want to look at most and go from there,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,21
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,100,I agree,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,Kirk made a good point. We could test with 4% but the cost might not be justifiable,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,17
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,We haven't mentioned changing the surfactant to steric hindering,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,9

3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,then change the surfactant to steric,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,thats 2 devices,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,3
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,97,i think we should change surfactants,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,6
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,then maybe change another attribute on each and thats 2 more,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,11

3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,97,yep,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,i think that would be best,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,6
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,99,at 2%,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,2
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,Yes. the increase in fouling resistance does not justify the cost it takes to add more.,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,16
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,96,"Ok. So we want to do all three processes with PMMA at 2% CNT, three with steric and two with negative?",0,0,1,0,0,0,3,21
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,96,And switch processes between those?,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,5
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,98,I think along those lines. Just need to choose whichever surfactant we want to test with the three proccesses,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,19
3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,100,I think negative charge and steric hindrance,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7

3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,100,do three with negative charge,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,5

3d,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,96,"ok, well from our last discussion everyones favorite was negative charge, so why don't we do all three with that and two with steric hindrance",0,0,0,0,0,0,3,25

2e,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,Player,118,I did the same thing as Patrick.

I don't really have that information (as you already know) and he also said that I was supposed to turn it in by 8am today... well I got on here yesterday afternoon/evening and there wasn't anything sent back to me yet. I went and looked at his message and he sent it to me at 8pm last night. It's almost impossible to think that someone would get on here during that 12 hour window to make sure that their assignment went through so they can have it turned in by 8am.

Based off of Alan DuChamp's recommendation for reliability, I recommend trying at 1.0%CNT to reach his desired standard of the device operating at 75% of its orginal value at the end of a 9 hour treatment.

4k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,291,"I made my first design as my favorite design. That was the PSF1Don design.

4k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,292,"I think we should try to use one type of surfactant in these tests, being Steric Hindrance surfactant, as a constant because it has the better traits in a majority of factors.

4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,I think we should go with the most evenly rounded sample,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,11
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,289,well we can pretty much take BCR out because its the same in all so we just have to compare the other 4 aspects,1,0,0,0,0,0,6,24

4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,I think the best sample to pick is Don's #1,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,10
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,290,well wasnt Don's first prototype about the average?,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,8
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,289,it has the lowest flux though and didnt Don just say flux should be important,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,15
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,289,?,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,1
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,289,I think Dons 3rd would be better because it has significantly better flux even though it is a little more expensive,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,21
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,Yea but according to my consultant the average flux we should be meeting is 13.5,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,15
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,290,oh.  i was just looking at the graph and saw it was the average over all the tests,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,18

4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,The other samples are going well above that and sacrificing other factors stats for the high flux,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,17
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,289,Youre right it does meet the preferred flux requirement for the consultants,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,12
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,"Its just above the standard for reliability too, the standard being 8",0,0,0,0,0,0,3,12
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,can someone tell me about the marketability of it and the cost? if those are also above standards then its a pretty good candidate,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,24

4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,Oh,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,289,but Dons 1 does meet both preferred,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,Yea and your Prototype 5 is pretty good option too,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,10
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,Not as rounded but an other good option,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,No offense,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,2
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,289,None taken haha. but i think dons 1 would be good if we want to meet alot of standards and his 3 would be good too because it meets the standards and more with a slight increase in cost,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,39
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,290,So Dons's first one is better for the market while still meeting standards,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13

4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,292,yea,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,1
4k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,289,I agree we should have a few options,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,8

5k,Reflection team discussion of surfactants,Player,295,yeah I considered that too but the only reason I chose Steric Hindering over negative charge was because the marketability was so high,0,1,0,0,1,0,5,23

5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,296,That sounds good. I made mine so that I had one for each consultant and what they were looking for,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,20
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,293,ok well why dont you guys go through and find the factors that result in the least cost and i will go make it,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,24
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,294,I'll create the prototype in FEEDS,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,6
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,293,ok well the most cost effective surfactant was no surfactant,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,295,Is that practical though?,0,0,1,0,0,0,5,4
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,293,also CNT% had no affect on cost so we can choose whatever for that,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,14
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,294,"So we need to chose the process, surfactant, and nanotube concentration",0,1,0,0,0,0,4,11
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,296,Dry jet wet printing is best for cost,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8

5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,294,We have to keep in mind the goal of the product is still to perform.,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,15

5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,295,either negative or steric,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,296,uhh maybe the one for best reliability because it sort of effects flux,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,13
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,295,thats a good point,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,4
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,294,I was thinking that two but they tied on that,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,10
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,293,lets do hydro then,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,4
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,296,i think hydro would be good,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,6

5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,296,yeah they dont,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,3
5k,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,293,they do have some affect because the mroe reliable it is the less blood cell reactivity,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,16

5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,296,I think that they performed the tasks they were built for rather well,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,13
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,293,i agree,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,293,although I think we could have made the flux model higher,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,11
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,296,that was 3 right?,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,4
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,295,agreed but I don't really like the idea of each of them only performing one task exceptionally well,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,18

5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,293,i actuallly think the one we built to be best all around preformed amazingly well. it had the higest flux as well,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,22
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,295,well 3 & 5 cause they were the same,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,9
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,293,yes that is true,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,295,yeah the best all around design matches #3 which was designed mainly for flux,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,14
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,293,but that is really just coincidence. We combined the aspects we thought were the best and it just happneed to match the model that had the most flux,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,28
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,293,i mean if you look at the chart it is almost smack dab in the middle of all the others. And by chart i mean the one with the colors,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,30
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,294,"Yes, but the point being discussed is that the model we designed (referred to as 3 or 5) performed well.",0,0,0,0,0,0,4,20
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,295,yeah I agree. #2 shouldn't be considered the cost is nearing too high with a lower marketability. The flux is the worst out of all of them and the BCR isn't too great either.,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,34
5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,293,oh well yes your correct it did very well,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,9

5k,Reflection team discussion of first batch results,Player,293,I think overall the best model is the one we designed to be best overall,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,15

3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,352,There wasn't any difference mentioned but it would make sense that 4% would cost more,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,15

3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,351,Like could we cut some of the cost here by lowering that percentage,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,13
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,352,"But Wayne Anderson also said he was looking for marketability and blood-cell reactivity, not price",0,0,0,0,0,0,3,15

3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,351,It seems like it would make sense that 4% would cost more. But as long as we don't know we csan stick with 4%,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,24

3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,351,I personally think marketability is more important than cost here. especially since no surfactant doesnt perform well in general,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,350,My reasoning behind none here was just the insanely low price per unit she gave out which is impossible to reach with any surfactat. I do agree though it is less marketable,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,32
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,350,Was the Negative Charge marketable?,0,0,1,0,0,0,6,5

3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,352,Yeah. I dont think surfactant matters as much on this one. I agree with Will. I think the 4% CNT will make it marketable enough without surfactant,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,27
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,351,Negative chare is twice as marketable as no surfactant,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,351,But is 200$ more,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,350,How much is the cost difference? because it its not twice as expensive then it might be worth it,0,0,1,0,1,0,6,19

3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,350,So then we should probably go either no surfactant or Steric Hindering,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,12
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,352,It sounds like she's really strict on the pricing though,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,10

3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,350,Yes I agree then it kind of does besides that we do want  to reach her goal of price either way,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,21
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,350,I agree with both,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4

3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,350,Exactly,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,1
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Mentor,349,They are connected. Cost is a factor in marketability. But marketability is a projected estimate of how the product will do on the market. So there are other factors that influence it as well.,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,34
3n,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,350,So we literally cannot meet her goal,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,7

3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,373,and i agree with zach,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,377,What about the process? I see we all chose either Vapor or Dry Jet. Do we want to continue with both?,0,1,1,0,0,0,8,21

3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,375,Okay So process,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,3
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,373,and i think we should make three of out prototypes with vapor and two with the dry jet,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,18
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,376,i liked the vapor best,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,5

3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,374,I thought there was a very minimal difference in the processes so maybe we could just use the process that is best for the attribute or attributes we want at peak performance,0,0,0,0,1,0,4,32
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,376,That's a good idea,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,4

3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,373,ok and for mine it was between vapor and dry jet but there was a minimal difference,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,375,Okay so we have pmma steric negative and between 1-2%,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,375,"So one could be pmma, steric, 1%, and which process",0,0,0,0,0,0,4,10

3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,376,so for the first two lets do vapor,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,8
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,377,Agree,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,1
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,373,we should have one at 1%  at 1.5% and 2 at 2%,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,12

3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,375,Great idea.,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,2
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,376,and then for the percent for those two lets do like 2% so that the only thing different between the two prototypes is the membrane,1,1,0,0,0,0,6,25
3o,Team designs batch using 1 material,Player,373,also i have to step away for a moment my head is starting to hurt and i agree with lena,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,20
